> Leaching happens when excess water, through rainfall or irrigation, takes water-soluble nutrients out of the soil.

**Remedy**

Incorporating crop residues,compost, manure or mulching enriches soil organic matter and has a positive impact on soil structure and water retention capacity, which in turn reduces the risk of nutrient leaching.
