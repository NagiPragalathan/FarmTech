> For Gravelly soil: water runs through, and can't keep our plants hydrated enough. In heavy clay soil, water just sits there and never gets to the roots, or eventually gets to the roots but stays there, potentially drowning your plants and trees.

**Remedy**

Adding organic matter such as manure, compost or mulch to the top soil.  Any organic matter will work to build soil structure and its ability to hold onto water. Compost and manure are preferred because they are rich in nutrients, which they drip-feed to your crops.
