> Slope gradient is important because it influences the rate at which runoff flows on the soil surface and erodes the soil.

**Remedy**

Slopes can be stabilized by adding a surface cover to the slope, excavating and changing (or regrading) the slope geometry, adding support structures to reinforce the slope or using drainage to control the groundwater in slope material. If slope is not steep, plant your crops across the slope using contour rows, terraces, or raised beds. This not only makes it easier for you but also prevents problems with erosion.
