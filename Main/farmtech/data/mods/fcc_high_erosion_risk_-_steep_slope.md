> Slope gradient is important because it influences the rate at which runoff flows on the soil surface and erodes the soil.

**Remedy**

Consider building terraces to help slow down erosion as the crop takes hold. Leverage on the slope to design a cascading terrace to minimise erosion. 

Use erosion control blankets: There are many varieties of fiber, biodegradable, and compost blankets/mats on the market today, and they have all been designed with one aim; to minimize the effects of water erosion on slopes and embankments. They degrade slowly, allowing vegetation that may have been grown in the area to grow and take over the job of protecting the soil from erosion when the mats have finally degraded completely.
