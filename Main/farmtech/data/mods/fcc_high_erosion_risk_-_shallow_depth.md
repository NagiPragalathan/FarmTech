> Bare spots are often caused by inadequate growing conditions or by runoff washing away topsoil. In either case, once the protective vegetative cover is gone, erosion occurs at a faster pace. If erosion continues unabated, gullies may begin to form that will deepen and widen over time.

**Remedy**

Use erosion control blankets : There are many varieties of fiber, biodegradable, and compost blankets/mats on the market today, and they have all been designed with one aim; to minimize the effects of water erosion on slopes and embankments. They degrade slowly, allowing vegetation that may have been grown in the area to grow and take over the job of protecting the soil from erosion when the mats have finally degraded completely. 

Mulching: Placed over the roots of plants, compost mulch conserves water and stabilizes soil tem- peratures. In addition, compost mulch keeps plants healthy by controlling weeds, providing a slow release of nutrients, and preventing soil loss through erosion
