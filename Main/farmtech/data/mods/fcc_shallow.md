> Trees and shrubs that grow in shallow soils have less physical support from their root systems. Large plants, especially trees, growing in shallow soils are consequently vulnerable to wind and may blow down.

**Remedy**

Adding organic matter such as manure, compost or mulch to the top soil.  Any organic matter will work to build soil structure and its ability to hold onto water. Compost and manure are preferred because they are rich in nutrients, which they drip-feed to your crops.
