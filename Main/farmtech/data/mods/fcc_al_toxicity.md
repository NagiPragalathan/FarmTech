> Toxic levels of aluminium in the soil solution affect root cell division and the ability of the root to elongate. The root tips will be deformed and brittle and root growth and branching is reduced.

**Remedy**

Raising pH by broadcasting spread and cultivate lime into the soil, which is only effective in reducing aluminium toxicity in the top surface soil (0-15 cm depth). Calcium will displace aluminum in soils, allowing it to be leached below the rooting depths as long as there is enough moisture to draw it downwards.
