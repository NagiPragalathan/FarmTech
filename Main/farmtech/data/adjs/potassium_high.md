Primary risk of too much potassium is a nitrogen deficiency, which will stunt the growth of the plant. To reduce potassium in soil:

- Use products with low or no potassium
- Sift the soil and remove as many rocks as possible. This will prevent minerals in rocks, such as feldspar and micro, from releasing potassium into the soil
- Flush the soil with fresh water, and ensuring that the water is able to be drained away
